# sub-merger
Multiple subtitle merger.
I assume that you multiple subtitle & media files and ffmpeg is installed into your OS.
This script checks out media files (mp4 and subrip) in the directory where you locate this script.
First, we need to be sure that all subtitle tags / language abbreviations are correct and understandable by ffmpeg.
Then it checks mp4 files and corresponding subtitles. 
Finally it automatically merge them.
